## Description

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) is the premiere and safest, Enterprise-ready, Open Source File Sync and Share solution

["Nextcloud for Filelink"](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/nextcloud-filelink/) is a Thunderbird extension which makes it easy to send large attachments with Thunderbird by uploading them first to a Nextcloud server and by then inserting the link into the body of your email.

It is currently possible to upload files as large as 1GB.

## Installation

1. Zip all files located in the `src` folder such that the install.rdf and chrome.manifest are located in the root folder of the zip file
1. Change the file extension from .zip to .xpi
1. Open your Thunderbird, navigate to `Tools -> Add-Ons`, choose "Install Add-On From File..." and select the .xpi file
1. After installation restart Thunderbird

## Nextcloud configuration

1. Make sure that you have checked "Allow users to share via link" in the **"Sharing"** section of the admin page of your Nextcloud installation. If you have also checked-in the **"Enforce password protection"** option, make sure to fill the **"Password for uploaded files"** field when setting up the add-on in Thunderbird
1. By default your mail attachments will be saved in a folder called `Mail-attachments`.

*Note: It's also possible to use a different folder name. Simply type the name of the folder you want to use when setting up the provider in Thunderbird*

1. Navigate to `Edit -> Preferences -> Attachments` 
1. Choose the `Outgoing` tab
1. Click the Add button. The "Set up Filelink" panel will open.
1. Select the desired service provider from the drop-down list.
1. Select Nextcloud from the list and type in the URL to your server as well as your login and password

*Note: If you want to send your email attachments to a different folder, you will have to modify the path given in "Storage path"*

Once setup is complete, Thunderbird will always ask you if you want to upload big attachments to Nextcloud.

## Requirements

* Nextcloud: 11.0.2 and newer
* Thunderbird: 17.0 and <= 67. For Thunderbird 68+, use https://gitlab.com/joendres/filelink-nextcloud instead (see https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-filelink/issues/80).

## Known issues

* It's not possible to use the same Filelink provider more than once
* You can only create public links
* Public links will always have the same password
* You cannot edit your Filelink account. You have to delete and re-create it if you need a change (password, folder, link password, port, etc.)
